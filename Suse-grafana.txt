What is Grafana?

Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.

FEATURES OF GRAFANA
▪ Unify your data, not your database - Grafana doesn't require you to ingest data to a backend store or vendor
database. Instead, Grafana takes a unique approach to providing a "single-pane-of-glass" by unifying your existing data,
wherever it lives.
■ Data everyone can see - Grafana was built on the principle that data should be accessible to everyone in your
organization, not just the single Ops person.
■ Dashboards that anyone can use - Not only do Grafana dashboards give insightful meaning to data collected from
numerous sources, but you can also share the dashboards you create with other team members, allowing you to explore
the data together.
■ Flexibility and versatility - Translate and transform any of your data into flexible and versatile dashboards. Unlike
other tools, Grafana allows you to build dashboards specifically for you and your team.
