First create Git-hub repo (git-poc).
download git bash tool & install it using default settings.
And use git from git bash or Command promt.
create a new folder where we gonna init the Git.
Add any file (.txt,.php,.sql etc..) and name it without any spaces.
go that file and open git bash/cmd.
after that give
	git init
	git status (here you can see the untracked files)
	git add . (this command will change the file state from "wroking area" to "staged" or "yet to commit files" )
	git rm --cached <file> (this command will change the file state to "unstaged")
	git commit -m "message" ( this command will commit the file which were in the staged area.)
		If its our first time then it will ask "Tell me who you are".
	git config --global user.email "your github email ID"
	git config --global user.name "your github user name"
	git remote add origin url of your github repo(this command will add remote orgin to your Github reop)
	git push -u origin main/master (this command will push the code to github)
	git log (using this command we can get the commit id/ commit hash, using that we can roll back to previous or any wanted previous commit)
	git checkout commit-hash/commit-ID
	git branch (shows which branch is in current use)
	git branch --delete <branch name> or git branch -d <branch-name> (this will delete the created branch)
	git branch <new branch name> (this will create a new branch)
	git merge <branch name> (this command will merge two branchs into one)
	git pull <reop-url> (this command will pull the updates from the remote repo)
	git pull 

Note:
we can use "git log" to see logs file like commit data
